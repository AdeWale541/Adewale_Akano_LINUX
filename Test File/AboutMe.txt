I am Akano Adewale, a software tester in training. Entering the tech industry has always been 1 of my life goals. Registering for IT courses is one of my hobbies.
Some of the courses have taken include Fortran programming, IOT, cybersecurity, Data analysis with Power BI and now software testing. Working on computers is something 
I find compelling. Writing programming languages is my favourite aspect of IT. I'm also fond of analyzing data and I'm taking some courses on that and looking to 
expand my knowledge.
